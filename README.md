# WSN_Localizer

We assume a certain number of WSN nodes, say N, are placed randomly in a plain so that each node has at least a few say M minimum neighboring nodes within its transmitting range.
We assume that each node participates in a localization procedure (algorithm) at regular intervals to generate a list of all nodes N with their node-no, location information x and y using received signal strengths.
